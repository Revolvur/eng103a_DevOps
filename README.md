### Monolith, 2 tier & Microservices Architectures

In a monolithic application, everything is so integrated together, you have to rebuild everything anytime you make a change.

Microservices are the opposite of a monolith. You have small services that can be deployed individually. Each service has a focus on one aspect of the business functionality. The services are loosely coupled. That means, that the services work relatively independent of each other and only communicate with the other services, if necessary.
