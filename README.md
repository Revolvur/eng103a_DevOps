# What is DevOps
## Why DevOps
### Benefits of DevOps

**Four pillars of DevOps best practice**
- Ease of Use

*-* troubleshoot release / configuration issues and communicate their discoveries back to the dev team for resolutions that could not be implemented by the DevOps team themselves.

*-* Reaching into each others' toolboxes and using the tools of the others.

*-* Infrastructure that is described by code can thus be tracked, validated, and reconfigured in an automated way.

*-* Pipeline to keep track of everything


- Flexibility 
- (product owner can add changes)
- Robustness - faster delivery of product
- Cost - cost effective (automating process)

### Monolith, 2 tier & Microservices Architectures

In a monolithic application, everything is so integrated together, you have to rebuild everything anytime you make a change.

Microservices are the opposite of a monolith. You have small services that can be deployed individually. Each service has a focus on one aspect of the business functionality. The services are loosely coupled. That means, that the services work relatively independent of each other and only communicate with the other services, if necessary.
